TO DO Later:
Make a home/landing page - dashboard?
Add timestamps to all tables
Add Non-tax reason
Fix JS imports from footer
Clean up spacing for arrays and variable equals


PLAN OF ATTACK:
- work on sales orders
    - JS bug that I think is due to some tax fields I changed on the SO form. Maybe hold off until the SO
        page is completely done, since this JS will probably keep breaking as I keep changing it around.
    - A user can make a new sales order with or without items on it, but it has to be tied to a customer.
    - A user can add/remove items from the sales order and modify information on it.
    - A user can 'sell' items on the sales order to keep as receipt records of sale -> new schema.
    - A user can toggle the status of a sales order manual or cancel an order
        - Sales orders cannot be deleted unless they don't have items attached? - work on this concept
- work on rental orders
    - Very similar to sales orders
    - Will need to create infrastructure for rental items first -> items need to be taken out of regular
        inventory to be turned into rental items -> think about the Brightree concept where you set up items
        to be rental & purchase -> maybe worth looking into?
